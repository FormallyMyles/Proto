Howdy!

This is Proto! The aim of this project is to provide a tool that can analyse jar files which are obfuscated, (e.g Minecraft!).

This project is very much in development, hopefully one day it will be the most magical tool around.


Usage:

    java -jar proto.jar <jarfile>

Where jarfile is the file you want to extract data from, for now it saves to output.json.

In the future we hope to have it so you can pass in a mapped jar and have it generate some sort of mapping so you can identify files
